## Name Application back end

Used Spring Boot for this project. It's a bit of an overkill for a project this small, but wanted to show that I can do Java as well. Front end is done with React.js, located in a [separate repository](https://github.com/Paul-Matt/namesapp_front).
The app is deployed in Heroku: [Name Application front](https://names-application.herokuapp.com/), [Name Application back](https://namesapp-backend.herokuapp.com/names).
